#region How to overcome the unsuccessful application Development problem?
/*

  1. We need to use the correct architecture.
  2. As a developer, we need to follow the Design Principles.
  3. Again we need to choose the correct Design Patterns as per the project requirements.

#region SOLID Design Principles
/*

  * The SOLID Design Principles are the design principles that basically used to manage most of the software design problems that generally we encountered in our day-to-day programming.
  * These design principles are provided with some mechanism that will make the software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

#region SOLID Acronym
/*

  S stands for the 'Single Responsibility Principle' which is also known as SRP.
  O stands for the 'Open-Closed Principle' which is also known as OSP.
  L stands for the 'Liskov Substitution Principle' which is also known as LSP.
  I stand for the 'Interface Segregation Principle' which is also known as ISP.
  D stands for 'Dependency Inversion Principle' which is also known as DIP.

#region Why do we need SOLID Design Principles?
/*

  * As a developer, we start developing applications using our experience and knowledge.
  * But over time, the applications might arise bugs or we may receive change requests.
  * We need to alter the application design for every change request or for a new feature request.
  * After some time we might need to put a lot of effort, even for simple tasks, it might require the full working knowledge of the entire system. 
  * But we can’t blame change or new feature requests as they are part of the software development.
  * We can’t stop them and refuse them either.
  ? So who is the culprit here?
  ! Obviously, it is the design of the application.

#region Advantages of SOLID Design Principles in C#
/*

  * As a developer, while you are designing and developing any software applications, then you need to consider the following points.

    1. Maintainability

        - Day by day the business grows for the organization and as the business grows you need to enhance the software with new changes.
        - So you need to design the software in such a way that it should accept future changes with minimum effort and without any problem.

    2. Testability

      - Test-Driven Development (TDD) is one of the most important key aspects nowadays when you need to design and develop a large-scale application.
      - We need to design the application in such a way that we should test each individual functionalities.

    3. Flexibility and Extensibility

      - Nowadays flexibility and extensibility both are very much required for enterprise applications.
      - So we should design the application in such a way that it should be flexible so that it can be adapted to work in different ways and extensible so that we can add new features easily with minimum modifications.

    4. Parallel Development

      - The Parallel Development of an application is one of the most important key aspects.
      - As we know it is not possible to have the entire development team will work on the same module at the same time.
      - So we need to design the software in such a way that different teams can work on different modules.

    * SOLID prensipleri geliştirilen yazılımın
      - birçok geliştiricinin işbirliği içinde üzerinde çalışabileceği düzeyde anlaşılır,
      - geliştirilebilmeye açık düzeyde esnek
